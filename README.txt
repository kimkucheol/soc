SSG's Own Commander

This is one of my thousand attempts to code a decent Total Commander
replacement, obviously orphaned again. 

Functions like Copy/Rename/Delete should work. You should be able to 
browse ZIP files. Icons are matched properly. It should compile under
Lazarus too.

Keyboard support should be decent. TC shortcuts like Ctrl-PageUp, Ins,
should work.

One neat idea is that when you select an item it calcualtes it's size
in the background.
